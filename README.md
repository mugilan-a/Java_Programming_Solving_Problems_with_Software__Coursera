# Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming">This Java Course</a> from Coursera is a part of the Java Specialization, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization</a>.

I've also included quiz test cases for some, which can be called for answering the quiz.

I finished the course in a month. Here's the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/LVQFHJACHXV4">Certificate</a>.

<h3>NOTE:</h3>
There is a custom package involved in this course. So it's simpler to run code in the <a href="http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2">custom Bluej IDE</a> made by Duke's University.
